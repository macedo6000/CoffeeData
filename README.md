# Home Mortgage Data Project - Segment 1

The Home Mortgage Disclosure Act was passed in 1975 to protect homeowners by mandating that financial institutions make home mortgage data publicly available[^1].

The Home Mortgage Database was obtained from the federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), which annually collects, aggregates, and makes publicly available mortgage data as required by the HMDA. The most recent release for California, 2017, saw a dataset containing over 1.7 million records of mortgage data[^2].

The origin of this database is California HMDA Mortgage Data from 2017. The dataset was downloaded in CSV format from CFPB's website[^3], www.consumerfinance.gov. After extensive cleaning, the original dataset "raw_data.csv" contained 1,709,502 rows of string, integer, and float values, spread across 78 columns. This file was further preprocessed for exploratory data analysis (EDA). The preliminary results of that analysis can be found below:
