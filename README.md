# Evaluating the Criteria for Eligibility for Home Mortgages

#### The selected topic and the reasoning for that selection
In this project, team 5 will be analyzing the criterias for eligibility for home mortgages. The reason why we chose to analyze loan procceses is to identify what are potential factors on these applications. By the year, the reality of wanting to have our dream homes for our families becomes a much more serious topic. Understanding loans and acknowledging what components increases our chances of securing credit at the most favorable terms can save you thousands. As a team, we will examine multiple indicators such as demographic, personal, and financial information for each mortgage application. For the demographic, we want to identify if there is bias on applicants that come from a more diverse background involving gender, race, and ethnicity. Personal features consists of their location, HOEPA status, or the number of owners in an occupied unit. Lastly, the applicants financial information, which should be the most important, uses data such as their income and loan information. By studying this dataset, the team hopes to further understand loan applications and help others identify what factors can potentially predict the likelyhood of getting an offer. As well, to eliminate lending discrimination in this case if the issues rises. 

#### A description of the data
The original CSV file contains 1,709,502 rows of string, integer, and float numeric data. The data portrays the application of house owners in California in 2017 and their financial, personal, and demographic background. Most importantly, it shows if the applicant was approved or rejected.

#### The questions that the team plans to answer with the project
* Is there a gender bias present in the data?
* Is there an ethnicity bias present in the data?
* Is there a racial bias present in the data?
* Does the applicants county/address have an affect on approval? 
* Does the applicants income have an affect on approval?
