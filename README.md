### Presentation

#### The selected topic and the reasoning for that selection
In this project, team 5 will be analyzing the criterias for eligibility for home mortgages. The reason why we chose to analyze loan procceses is to identify what are potential factors on these applications. By the year, the reality of wanting to have our dream home for our families becomes a much more serious topic. Understanding loans and acknowledging what components increases our chances of securing credit at the most favorable terms can save you thousands. As a team, we will examine three different indicators: diversity, location, and income. For diveristy, we want to identify if there is bias on applicants that come from a diverse background involving gender, race, and ethicity. We will also identify if the county of where this loan is coming from has any affect on the applications results and lastly, on the applicants income. By studying this dataset, the team hopes to further understand loan applications and help others identify what factors can potentially predict the likelyhood of getting an offer. As well, to eliminate lending discrimination in the world.
