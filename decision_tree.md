# HMDA Data - Machine Learning Model Analysis with Decision Trees

[intro about ML, decision trees and what makes them good for home mortgage approvals.

note. something in module 18 about decision trees not being liable to problems with linearity of dataset]

## Overview

As part of an extensive ETL process, important columns from the original dataset were extracted into a Machine Learning Dataset. Accordingly, the resulting dataset was composed entirely of columns containing categorical data with numerical datatypes. The numeric dataset was further split into *input variables* and *target variable*, listed below: 
*Input Variables*

* population
* minority_population
* hud_median_family_income
* tract_to_msamd_income
* number_of_owner_occupied_units
* number_of_1_to_4_family_units
* applicant_sex
* co_applicant_sex
* applicant_ethnicity
* co_applicant_ethnicity
* applicant_race_1
* co_applicant_race_1
* loan_amount_000s
* applicant_income_000s
* loan_type
* loan_purpose
* purchaser_type
* property_type
* owner_occupancy
* hoepa_status
* county_code
*Target Variables*

* action_taken
